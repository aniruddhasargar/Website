    <h1>TERMS OF USE</h1><br>
    <p>
        Our web portal is the subject of the following Terms of Use which are agreed as binding under a contractual relationship between the user and the service provider when this web portal is called up. Where special conditions for the individual use of this web portal deviate from the following Terms of Use, this shall be explicitly pointed out at the appropriate location in the web portal. The special Terms of Use shall then apply in addition in each individual case.
</p><br>
<h3>Trademarks, labelling rights and copyrights</h3>
<p>This web portal contains data and information of various kinds which are protected by trademarks and/or copyright by the service provider or, in individual cases, by a third party. It is therefore not permitted to download, duplicate or distribute the web portal as a whole or parts thereof. Duplication as far as is technically necessary for the purposes of browsing is permitted in particular.</p><br>
<p>All rights relating to text, graphics and Java scripts shall belong to R. STAHL Aktiengesellschaft unless otherwise specified. Any form of further use requires the explicit consent of R. STAHL Aktiengesellschaft.</p><br>
<p>Third-party and in-house markings, brands in particular, have not generally been identified as such. The absence of such a marking shall not signify that this is a free, non-protected name as specified under trademark and labelling law.</p><br>
<h3>Liability/links</h3>
<p>The service provider shall be liable for the content of its web portal in accordance with statutory provisions. The inclusion of references and links to the web portals of third parties does not make the content of the reference or link the property of the service provider. The content does not constitute any responsibility on the part of the service provider for the data and information already held on such portals. The service provider has no influence on the content saved under the link. The service provider shall not therefore assume liability for any illegal, incorrect or incomplete content or for any damage or loss caused by the use of any content saved under the link.</p><br>
<p>The user shall use the Internet at their own risk. In particular, the service provider shall not be liable for any failure of the Internet or failure of access to the Internet due to technical reasons.</p><br>
<p>It is permitted to set up a link to this web portal where this is solely intended as a cross-reference. The service provider reserves the right to revoke this permission. The framing of this web portal is not permitted.</p><br>
<p>Please send us a short e-mail should you have any questions, or if you determine any breaches of the German Telemedia Act (TMG) on our website.</p><br>
<h3>Completeness and accuracy of data and information</h3>
<p>We shall provide no guarantee of the completeness and accuracy of the data and information on our web portal.</p><br>
<h3>Place of jurisdiction and applicable law</h3>
<p>If the contractual partner is a merchant, a public corporate entity or a special fund governed by public law, the place of jurisdiction is the service provider's registered office. German law shall apply, with the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p><br>
<h3>Reservation of rights to make changes</h3>
<p>The service provider reserves the right to modify these Terms of Use from time to time and to adapt them to technical and legal developments. The user shall be notified separately of any changes.</p><br><br>
